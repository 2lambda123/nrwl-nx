# Nx and Angular Version Compatibility Matrix

Below is a reference table that matches versions of Angular to the version of Nx that is compatible with it. The table shows the version of Angular, the recommended version of Nx to use and the range of Nx versions that support the version of Angular.

We provide a recommended version, and it is usually the latest minor version of Nx in the range provided because there will have been bug fixes added since the first release in the range.
