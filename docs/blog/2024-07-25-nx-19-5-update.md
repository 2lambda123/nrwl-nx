## NEW: Pattern Support for `targetDefaults`

We've added Pattern Support for `targetDefaults` in your `nx.json` file.

Generally speaking, `targetDefaults` are a way for you to specify default configurations for your workspace. For example, if for your workspace, your `test` tasks always depend on your `build` task to have run before the `test`s can run, you'd add this as a `targetDefault`:

```json
{
  "targetDefaults": {
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["build"]
    }
  }
}
```

By adding pattern matching to `targetDefault`s, we can support a wider range of target names, which fits in really well with recent enhancements from Project Crystal, like task atomization. For example, the `@nx/playwright` plugin will automatically add in a task with the name `e2e-ci--${testFileName}` for every playwright spec file in your project. With this new pattern support in `targetDefaults`, we can define default behavior for all these tasks.

The following will set all such tasks to depend on their `build` task:

```json
{
  "targetDefaults": {
    "e2e-ci--**/*": {
      "dependsOn": ["build"]
    }
  }
}
```

## NEW: Individual Targets Can Now Opt Out of Parallelism

The ability to "Atomize" larger tasks by automatically breaking them up into smaller pieces is a really cool enhancement that is enabled by Nx Project Crystal. Especially when combined with the ability to distribute tasks across many machines by using Distributed Task Execution from Nx Agents.

This approach can break down a massive and long-running end-to-end test suite into many smaller tasks. Then you can divide the time it takes to run the entire suite by the number of machines provided via Nx Agents.

However, previously when using this approach, there were some limitations regarding parallelism. Most end-to-end tests cannot run on the same machine at the same time due to shared ports, conflicting database states, etc.

The solution in the past was to add a `--parallel=1` option, which was a bit clunky. For example:

```terminal
> nx run-many --targets=lint,test,e2e,build --parallel=1
```

This command above is used to run all lint, test, e2e, and build tasks present in your monorepo. The `--parallel=1` option is needed in order for your e2e tasks to work properly (so as to avoid the problems of running multiple end-to-end tests on the same machine at one time).

Howeve in this scenario we'd also be limiting the parallelism of all our other tasks - which are fine to run in parallel on the same machine.

To address this, all tasks now support a `parallelism` property. By setting this property to `false`, you can now inform the Nx task runner to not attempt to run a certain task in parallel. For example setting this in your `targetDefaults` will mark all atomized e2e tasks in to not run in parallel:

```json
{
  // ...
  "targets": {
    "e2e-**/*": {
      // ...
      "parallelism": false
    }
  }
}
```

This way we can simply run the command:

```terminal
> nx run-many --targets=lint,test,e2e,build
```

And in CI, Nx Agents will allow all tasks to run in parallel on the same machine, except for the atomized end-to-end tasks, which will only run in isolation.

## Gradle: Tests Can Be Atomized

Our new `@nx/gradle` plugin now supports Test Atomization out of the box.

This means that as you add tests in your gradle projects, we'll automatically create a new tasks for each test class, allowing you to distribute the execution of these tasks in your CI pipeline.

## WASM (and StackBlitz!!) Support

Nx now has support for WASM - or WebAssembly. This means that you can create a StackBlitz with a whole Nx Workspace inside of it and run all Nx capabilities from their embedded terminal.

We're excited for this as it opens up many interesting use-cases, including easier ways of sharing examples, better opportunities for reproduction of issues or bugs, and potential for us to use embedded examples in our documentation in the future.

## Support for React 19 (rc) and Angular 18.1

Nx 19.5 adds support for the React 19 release candidate and updated our Angular package to support the latest Angular minor version: 18.1.
