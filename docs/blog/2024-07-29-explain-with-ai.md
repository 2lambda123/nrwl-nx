It's Friday, and you absolutely, positively have to deploy to production. But you can't get CI to pass your PR. What do you do? It's an inevitable part of your life as a developer, and you've built a collection of tools to deal with it: Google, MDN, Discord, ChatGPT. We've got one more tool to your toolbox: "Explain with AI" for Nx Cloud.

"Explain with AI" is a new feature for all Nx Cloud Pro users that is going to help you troubleshoot those pesky failing tasks. Using the power of ChatGPT, we use the terminal output and other Nx task information to give you a suggested fix for any failing task. This means the suggestion has the context you need to get to the bottom of your failing task. Smash the "Explain with AI" button on any failing task to get back to work.

_The "Explain with AI" button in the upper right-hand corner is your ticket to a fast answer._

This is going to help you get to the bottom of the failing task more efficiently by keeping you in the same context longer. No more switching back and forth between a dozen tabs with different solutions. No more providing the right context for your masterfully written chat prompt. Get your suggested fix and get back to work.

## How can I start using this today?

"Explain with AI" requires enabling AI Features for your organization. You'll need to be a org admin to do this. Go to your org settings, and check out the Enable AI Features section. Maybe check with your boss first before accepting the AI terms of service.
