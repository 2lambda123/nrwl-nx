Nx 19.8 is here! This is our last minor release before we get ready to move ahead into Nx v20, which should land in October around the same time as the [Monorepo World Conference]()!

As always, you can find the general details for all Nx releases on our [changelog](/changelog), as well as details on our [Github Releases for the Nx repo](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/releases).

## Nx Import

In Nx 19.8, [`nx import`](/nx-api/nx/documents/import) has now moved from beta support to now generally available!

Nx Import is a new [top-level command of the Nx CLI](/reference/nx-commands) which allows you to import projects along with its git history from some other repository into your current Nx worksapce.

Keep an eye out for more on Nx Import on our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@nxdevtools) coming soon, and in the meantime be sure to check [the documentation](/nx-api/nx/documents/import) as this is now fully documented!

## Project Crystal Comes to Angular

[Project Crystal](/concepts/inferred-tasks) has come to Angular!

Project Crystal allows Nx to _infer_ tasks for projects in your workspace - rather than requiring that they exist in every `project.json` or `angular.json` file of your workspace.

## New Nx Workspaces Created with ESLint v9

When creating a new workspace with the command: `npx create-nx-workspace`, those workspaces will now be created with [`eslint`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) v9, and [`typescript-eslint`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript-eslint) v8 - their most recent versions respectively.

## Nx Release Enhancements

[`nx release`](/nx-api/nx/documents/release) is a framework/language/platform agnostic solution to versioning, publishing, and changelogs for your monorepo. We've been continuing to invest in Nx Release in 19.8, adding support specifically for [`pnpm publish`](https://pnpm.io/cli/publish) and [Github Enterprise Server](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/pull/26482)!

## Migrate to Latest

/%}

As always - updating Nx and its plugins is easy as we ship an [automated migration command](/features/automate-updating-dependencies).

```shell
npx nx migrate latest
```

After updating your dependencies, run any necessary migrations.

```shell
npx nx migrate --run-migrations
```
