## Library Utilities

**Nx** comes with utilities to simplify data persistence (data fetching, optimistic and pessimistic updates)
when implementing NgRx as well as utilities for testing NgRx code. These are a set of functions
and classes that you can import into your applications and libs. These come as part of the 
`@nrwl/nx` package.
