# Nx Agents: The Next Leap in Distributed Task Execution

Nx Agents represent the next evolution of [Nx Cloud's Distributed Task Execution (DTE)](/ci/features/distribute-task-execution), bringing a new level of efficiency and simplicity to your CI/CD pipelines. Features include dynamic scaling, flaky task re-running, and intelligent task splitting and distribution. Keep reading to learn more.

## Seamless Integration

Enabling task distribution with Nx Agents can be done in a single line. Simply add the following to your CI pipeline configuration:

```yaml
- name: Start CI run
  run: 'npx nx-cloud start-ci-run --distributes-on="8 linux-medium"'
  ...
```

Continue with your standard CI steps thereafter.

```yaml
  ...
- run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile
- name: Run verification
  run: 'npx nx affected -t build test lint && npx nx affected -t e2e-ci --parallel 1'
```

`linux-medium` is the name of the launch template that will be used to provision the agent. The default launch templates [can be found here](https://github.com/nrwl/nx-cloud-workflows/blob/main/launch-templates/linux.yaml). You can can also define your own template as can be [seen in the Nx codebase](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/blob/master/.nx/workflows/agents.yaml).

## Intelligent Dynamic Scaling

While [Nx Cloud's DTE](/ci/features/distribute-task-execution) requires static configuration of agents, often necessitating adjustments as your workspace evolves, Nx Agents introduce a dynamic scaling feature. This innovative approach automatically scales your CI resources, spinning up or tearing down agents in response to the specific demands of your pull requests (PRs).

## Revolutionizing Task Splitting

Consider an e2e project utilizing Cypress or Playwright. To leverage [affected](/ci/features/affected), [caching](/ci/features/remote-cache) and [distribution](/ci/features/distribute-task-execution), traditionally, you would need to break down your project into smaller, more manageable units. However, this can lead to a tedious and less efficient developer experience.

Nx Agents, in conjunction with a forthcoming Nx feature, solve this challenge by being able to dividing tasks (like e2e) into smaller, more refined units (e.g., at the file/test level). This enhances distribution across dynamically provisioned Nx Agents and can drastically reduce CI time.

## Flaky Task Re-Running: Enhancing Reliability

Flaky tasks can be a persistent challenge in software development. With Nx Agents, weâ€™ve developed a reliable method to detect and automatically re-run such tasks. Utilizing cache hash keys to identify tasks and leveraging data from previous runs on Nx Cloud, Nx Agents can re-run flaky tasks on different agents, up to a predetermined maximum number of retries. This process is entirely transparent to the user, ensuring a smooth and reliable CI/CD experience.
