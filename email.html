        <li>New Management Experiment</li>
        <ul>
            <li>PROBLEM: It's hard for eng managers to know what people they manage do day to day so they aren't as
                productive as they could be.
            </li>
            <li><i>TLDR: Combine eng manager and tech lead roles</i></li>
            <li>Every eng team is managed by 2 people.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Nx (+Nx Console and Lerna): Jack and Jason</li>
                <li>Cloud app: Nicole and Ben</li>
                <li>Cloud backend: Rares and Steve</li>
            </ul>
            <li>1 team lead from each team does 1:1s with everyone on the team every two weeks.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Jack with everyone on the Nx team (including Austin and Max)</li>
                <li>Nicole with everyone on the cloud app team</li>
                <li>Rares with everyone on the cloud infra/backend team</li>
            </ul>
            <li>It's up to each team how to divide some of the responsibilities.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>For instance, Rares and Steve will both do project management related activities but may manage
                    different projects.
                </li>
                <li>Jack, Nicole and Rares have the following responsibility:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Propagating information within the team</li>
                    <li>Being eng managers for the team</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Delegate ops questions to Whitney</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Victor will talk to Jack, Jason, Nicole, Ben, Rares and Steve every two weeks.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>James will meet with tech leads as well to make sure dev quality gets high.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Two people will report to people directly:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>James -- reports to Victor</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>OSS ambassador, Nx DX, release, TS story</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Victor originally thought of having some other person every engineer would talk to every 3 months to get
                high-level feedback, etc. However, given that tech leads will talk to each other during the planning
                phase every two months and will meet in person every 3 months, the general feedback was to try to do
                with the 3-month check-ins with someone. This is what we will try for the next 3 months. If you have any
                issues you think your tech lead won't be able to address, you can email Victor directly, and he will
                have a 1:1 with you.
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>James will still manage the perf cycle and best engineer practices.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>YOUR ACTIONS</b>: Tech leads should schedule 1:1s with their team. Get the notes from existing
                managers. I'd start with March 1 and let existing eng managers to wrap up what is needed. Eng managers
                should provide a summary for each person they manage outlining what they are struggling with, what they
                can do better etc. Basically, anything that could be helpful.
            </li>
            <li><b>EVALUATION</b>: This is an experiment. As part of June perf cycle we will evaluate if the change is
                good or we should rever it. It gives us 3 months, which should be enough.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Communication/Syncs</li>
        <ul>
            <li>1:1 within each team with the tech leads</li>
            <li>weekly or bi-weekly team standups</li>
            <li>bi-weekly updates from each team</li>
            <li>Every two months ALL eng leads, Victor, Juri, James and Miro (DPE), Isaac get together (virtually) to
                share what we planned for the next 2 month and share feedback.
            </li>
            <li>Every 3-4 months all leads get together in person.</li>
            <li>Have all-company calls twice a month.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Product Development Experiment</li>
        <ul>
            <li>PROBLEM: Product development is unstructured, which results in misalignment and miscommunication.</li>
            <li>We will use the Amazon Press Release method (same as readme-driven development) to outline out plan for
                features.
            </li>
            <li>This should help us:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>feature design</li>
                <li>planning</li>
                <li>getting alignment with sales</li>
                <li>getting alignment with devrel/marketing</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Jeff and Victor are running the first experiment.</li>
            <li>YOUR ACTIONS: Victor & Jeff will trial the process and will ask you to be involved.</li>
            <li>EVALUATION: This is an experiment. We will reevaluate by the end of August.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Testing, Documentation, Ownership</li>
        <ul>
            <li>PROBLEM: Features are informally defined. Testing and documentation are often not "owned" by the project
                owner.
            </li>
            <li>Engineers should talk to their leads about their proposals before posting them to get early feedback and
                reduce round-trip time.
            </li>
            <li>Once the proposal gets an informal OK, it has to be fleshed out: 1-3 pages of text + loom if helpful.
            </li>
            <li>Proposals are converted into planned efforts during planning phase.</li>
            <li>Every effort will include a walkthrough phase. Where after it is done, the person owning it will walk
                through sync or async what was done to the tech lead or some other senior person. The walkthrough must
                include how the things were tested and should include the documentation.
            </li>
            <li>In general, we want to encourage walkthroughs (looms or sync) with tech leads. We can use our best
                judgment to decide what deserves a walk-through. E.g., a big fix or a small improvement don't need one.
            </li>
            <li>YOUR ACTIONS: Follow the process ^^^.</li>
            <li>EVALUATION: This is an experiment. Evaluation at end of June.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Incident Management</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Set up rotation for "PagerDuty"</li>
            <li>Create incident escalation policy</li>
            <li>Create a way to notify clients</li>
            <li>Todos</li>
            <ul>
                <li><a>#Ben</a> upgrade BetterStack</li>
                <li><a>#Nicole</a> write statuses for status page</li>
                <li><a>#Nicole</a> ask lawyers about including SLA in TOS</li>
                <li><a>#Nicole</a> write up incident response doc</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Devrel & Docs</li>
        <ul>
            <li>PROBLEM: Docs is huge. Having Isaac alone managing it is an impossible task.</li>
            <li>We need to grow our devrel and docs team.</li>
            <li>Jack, Leo, Nicholas and Isaac will work together in the next two cycles to "catch up" with crystal,
                refresh the website etc.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>
